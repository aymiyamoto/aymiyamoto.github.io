      <h3> Maintenance mechanisms of the wintertime subtropical high over the south Indian Ocean </h3>
      Climatologically the surface Mascarene high over the subtropical south Indian Ocean shifts westward toward austral winter, and its strength as a planetary-wave component maximizes in late austral winter, unlike its counterpart over other subtropical oceans.
      While the maintenance mechanisms of the summertime Mascarene high was investigated by previous studies such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0709.1">Miyamoto et al. (2021)</a>, dynamics of the wintertime high has not been fully understood yet.
      The present study proposes that both the Asian summer monsoon and the enhanced storm-track activity maintained by the Agulhas SST front externally modulate the positively coupled system between the wintertime Mascarene high and low-level clouds to realize its unique seasonality.

      <h3> Low-cloud impact on the subtropical high over the south Indian Ocean </h3>
      Radiative impacts of low clouds can reinforce the subtropical high, but they have not been quantified yet.
      Here, we compare a fully coupled control simulation and a "no-low-cloud simulation," where the radiative effects of low-level clouds over the south Indian Ocean are artificially turned off.
      We show that low-cloud feedback onto the subtropical high is strong enough to explain most of the subtropical high in summer whereas it is weak in winter.
      See our papers for the mechanisms of this seasonal difference.

      <h3> Low-cloud distribution and its seasonality over the south Indian Ocean </h3>
      Low-level clouds over the south Indian Ocean exhibits unique features such as <br>
      - wintertime basin-wide enhancement of low-cloud amount in the subtropics <br>
      - enhanced low-cloud amount along the warm Agulhas Return Current.<br>
      These features cannot be explained solely by lower-tropospheric stability, which is a widely-used index for geographical and seasonal variations of low-cloud amount.
      Using recent satellite observations and atmospheric reanalysis datasets, we reveal the importance of cold advection by the subtropical high and midlatitude transient eddies on the enhancement of low-cloud amount.
